## Terra-Mar: Un continuum des mangroves aux abysses 
[2025](https://terramar.online) 

The Terra-Mar natural history exhibition, which took place at the Planet Ocean Aquarium in Montpellier, France, and at Torre Malakoff in Recife, Brazil, is a groundbreaking journey from mangroves to the deep sea. Idealised by the Franco-Brazilian research initiative TAPIOCA, it blends science, art, and environmental awareness to immerse visitors in the rich biodiversity of the tropical Atlantic. Through photographs, videos, and 3D models, the exhibition explores marine ecosystems, their role in human well-being, the threats they face, and the scientific and societal actions needed for their preservation. It’s a vibrant call to understand, feel, and act for the future of our oceans.

Held in the historic district of Recife Antigo, the festival featured a rich program including exhibitions, video showcases, game displays, seminars, and sound performances. It critically examined both the involuntary invasion of privacy and the social dynamics that lead individuals to willingly surrender personal data, reflecting on contemporary issues like leaked private content and corporate data profiling

The Cozinha Negra arts exhibition, held at the Museu de Arte Contemporânea de Pernambuco in Olinda from November 20 to 24, served as a laboratory for contemporary art, free technologies, and cultural memory. Curated by Mãe Beth de Oxum, Edson Barrus, Ricardo Ruiz, and Yann Beauvais, the event celebrated the inventive spirit of Black consciousness through multisensory experiences and communal creativity. It featured a dynamic mix of performances, poetry, dance, capoeira, hacklabs, and digital exchanges, all woven into a tapestry of shared knowledge and telepresence. As the exhibition proclaimed, it was *“comidas para o espírito que a cabeça não pode esquecer”* —food for the spirit that the mind cannot forget.

The Ser-tão Conectado arts exhibition at the Museu de Arte Contemporânea (MAC) in Recife reimagined the poetic universe of Luiz Gonzaga through the lens of technological nomadism. The show celebrated the joy of movement and connection, challenging the nostalgia often associated with the Brazilian *sertão*. Featuring interactive installations like Retratos do Possível by Coletivo 192.168 and Estudo Nômade #7 by Ricardo Brazileiro, the exhibition invited visitors to navigate Gonzaga’s legacy through immersive 360-degree panoramas, sound installations, and responsive environments.
