## CADUS Debate! Making in Times of COVID

<iframe width="800" height="420" src="https://app.media.ccc.de/v/cadusdebate-16-making-in-times-of-COVID-19/oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Debate visits Brazil! The makerspace [Casa Criatura](https://casacriatura.com/) in Olinda produced thousands of pieces of PPE (personal protective equipment) by mixing open, globally designed products with local practices, and donating it to local indigenous health authorities, Afro-Brazilian traditional communities and public hospitals. The makerspace also developed an open-source aerosol box with physicists and teachers from reference hospitals in the region, igniting a community of makers and healthcare professionals around it. And most importantly, the _demunis_, the ordinary citizens with community obligations, received support, too—the overarching question accompanying all these activities is how communities can better care for themselves during pandemics.
