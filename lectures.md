## CADUS Debate! Making in Times of COVID

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://app.media.ccc.de/v/cadusdebate-16-making-in-times-of-COVID-19/oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Debate visits Brazil! The makerspace [Casa Criatura](https://casacriatura.com/) in Olinda produced thousands of pieces of PPE (personal protective equipment) by mixing open, globally designed products with local practices, and donating it to local indigenous health authorities, Afro-Brazilian traditional communities and public hospitals. The makerspace also developed an open-source aerosol box with physicists and teachers from reference hospitals in the region, igniting a community of makers and healthcare professionals around it. And most importantly, the _demunis_, the ordinary citizens with community obligations, received support, too—the overarching question accompanying all these activities is how communities can better care for themselves during pandemics.

Panel presentation [SERENDIPITY CITY – INFORMAL URBAN PLANNING AND SOCIAL ARCHITECTURE](https://15.re-publica.com/en/session/serendipity-city-informal-urban-planning-and-social-architecture.html), Berlin, 2015. The urban environment is the expression of modern life. Cities grow fast, dynamically and not always in the way governments plan. In particular in developing countries, formal city planning seems to be in a race with informal urban development, settlements like so called slums that may serve the immediate needs of their inhabitants, but clash with the plans of those in power.
