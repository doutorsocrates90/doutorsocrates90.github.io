Frontiers Sociology, 18 March 2021 | [https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.629587](https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.629587)

Makerspaces—informal shared spaces that offer access to technologies, resources and a community of peer learners for making—across the globe initiated a rapid response to the lack of medical hardware supplies during the global pandemic outbreak in early 2020 caused by the Corona virus (COVID-19). As our health systems faced unexperienced pressure, being close to collapsing in some countries, and global supply chains failing to react immediately, makers started to prototype, locally produce and globally share designs of Open Source healthcare products, such as face shields and other medical supplies. Local collaboration with hospitals and healthcare professionals were established. These bottom-up initiatives from maker networks across the globe are showing us how responsible innovation is happening outside the constraints of profit-driven large industries. In this qualitative study we present five cases from a global network of makers that contributed to the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and healthcare-related products. We draw our cases from the experiences made in _Careables_, a mixed community of people and organizations committed to the co-design and making of open, personalized healthcare for everyone. With the presented cases we reflect on the potential implications for post-pandemic local production of healthcare products and analyze them from a social innovation perspective. These global experiences are valuable indications of transformative innovations that can reduce dependencies from international supply chains and mainstream mass production.

Masters dissertation. Honorable Mention for best dissertation of the year - Faculty of Administration Sciences - University of Pernambuco

August 2018

This research aims to identify the degree of innovation of Pernambuco cultural entities with community insertion, classified by BRA-LAW No 13.018 / 2014 as Culture Points. At the outset, a bibliographic study traces the etymology of innovation and its relation to sustainability and the Creative Economy, being Culture Points a part of it. Next, we analyse the investments in innovation in Brazil from the 1930s up to the 2017 Budget Law. Subsequently, it presents a set of existing innovation measurement tools and, from these, a mechanism is proposed to measure the degree of the entities concerned. An online questionnaire followed by semi-structured interviews applied in 33 state entities is analysed using the tool known as the Innovation Radar. It is perceived in the end that the organisations have a low degree of innovation, mainly because they do not understand the product of their work as marketable or the conceptually non-innovative aspect of cultural traditions.

This paper discusses the concepts of social and technological innovation in order to analyse their relations and contradictions. After a long period in which innovation was related to social processes, it has been related to technological and economic development in the last century. Social innovation as a concept has acquired a restrictive meaning is defined by many as actions to combat social exclusions and environmental degradation promoted by technological innovation. This study suggests a vision for innovation and its influence on environmental sustainability through a bibliographical analysis that demonstrates how innovation processes are techno-socially related. It uses an analytic matrix that allows comparing these concepts to understand how socio-technical innovations promote environmental, social and economical sustainability. In the end, it recommends more studies to determine and measure the innovative sustainable practices of an organisation in both the social and technological spheres.

Jan 25, 2019 - 35C3 – Refreshing Memories. Chaos Computer Club e.V. / Ach je Verlag

This paper summarises the session “The Critical Making Movement: How using critical thinking in technological practice can make a difference”, held at the 35th Chaos Communication Congress between 27-30. December 2018 in Leipzig, Germany. It begins with a short history of the maker movement, summarises current societal impacts achieved in makerspaces and criticism directed towards maker culture. The paper then offers critical thinking as a way to rethink professional practices conducted in makerspaces to achieve a more reflective practice and enable the utilisation of the resources available in makerspaces for a society-oriented and citizen-driven practice. The origins of such critical making practices are touched upon, which lie in critical technical practice, critical design and critical engineering. All 3 - very briefly summarised in this paper - influence current criti- cal making streams in academia as well as citizen-driven projects. The paper also offers a brief insight into current examples of academic syllabuses, research and citizens’ bottom-up projects. Two cases are further elaborated to inspire more grassroots critical making research: EngineeringGood and the Hack-a-Toy workshops in Singapore and LabCOCO with Contos de Ifa in Brazil. ISBN 978-3-947720-31-6

"Some years ago, the elements (ideas, conceptions, practices, people) that compose the current (so-called) Free Culture movement was appropriated by the bureaucrat and the capitalist. The ones that made use of the technologies and available media to the creation of actions that provided the debate on new perspectives of possible social arrangements (obtained by tools such as free licenses, networks of communication, open-source software), are today digested by the old apparatuses and social mechanisms that once they have used and questioned. They participated, many times unconsciously, in a “socio-professional training” to occupy the same functions established for the maintainers of a system that is distant from what we imagine as a possible human grouping, even more, distanced from freedom."

Jan 1, 2009 - Editora Peirópolis

Co-translation into Portuguese of Richard Barbrook's Imaginary Futures. In it, the author reflects on technological development taking into account its political motivations and economic objectives, as well as its social repercussions, and connecting information from the fields of science, technology, economics, politics, history and mass communication. Barbrook challenges new generations to seize the power of the Internet, to resist the status quo policy and to use the most powerful communication tool of the moment to shape their own destiny. His message: if we don't want the future to be what it used to be, we need to invent our own, truly revolutionary future.
