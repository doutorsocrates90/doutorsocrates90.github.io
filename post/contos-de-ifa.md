Contos de Ifá is a new media experience: an educational adventure web-game that has African-Brazilian mythology as the plot. The games are built during workshops for public school teachers focused on the use of the game as a pedagogical tool in the classroom, and methodology for the construction, together with the students, of new game-stories for the platform.
