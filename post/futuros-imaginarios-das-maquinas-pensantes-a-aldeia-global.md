Co-translation into Portuguese of Richard Barbrook's Imaginary Futures. In it, the author reflects on technological development taking into account its political motivations and economic objectives, as well as its social repercussions, and connecting information from the fields of science, technology, economics, politics, history and mass communication. Barbrook challenges new generations to seize the power of the Internet, to resist the status quo policy and to use the most powerful communication tool of the moment to shape their own destiny. His message: if we don't want the future to be what it used to be, we need to invent our own, truly revolutionary future.
