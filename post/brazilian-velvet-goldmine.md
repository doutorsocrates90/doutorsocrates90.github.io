"Some years ago, the elements (ideas, conceptions, practices, people) that compose the current (so-called) Free Culture movement was appropriated by the bureaucrat and the capitalist. The ones that made use of the technologies and available media to the creation of actions that provided the debate on new perspectives of possible social arrangements (obtained by tools such as free licenses, networks of communication, open-source software), are today digested by the old apparatuses and social mechanisms that once they have used and questioned. They participated, many times unconsciously, in a “socio-professional training” to occupy the same functions established for the maintainers of a system that is distant from what we imagine as a possible human grouping, even more, distanced from freedom."
