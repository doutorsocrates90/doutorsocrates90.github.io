Peace Hack Camps are intensive media literacy and inter-communal peace-building workshops lasting several days. They tap into open source tools and media for their ability to promote collaborative enterprise in learning and innovation, foster mutually beneficial interaction among communities, enable shared ownership and effectively distribute gained knowledge between members of formerly hostile groups.
